Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Given $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,…,a_n$ ( $n$ is even ). It will be divided into $n$/2 pairs. Please calculate the minimum sum of these products in every pair.

## Input

There will be two lines.

The first line will be an integer $n$.

The second line will be $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,…,a_n$.

For all test cases, $n$ is even and $2≤n≤10^5,|a_i|≤10^7$ for all $1≤i≤n$

## Output

Print the minimum sum of those pair products.
