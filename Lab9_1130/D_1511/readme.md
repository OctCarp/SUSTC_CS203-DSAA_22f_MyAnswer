## Description

Given a directed graph of $n$ vertices with $m$ edges and a vertex $S$ , Tenshi wants you to find the minimum number of **directed edges** that can be added so that $S$ can reach all vertices on the graph.

## Input

The first line of input consists of three integers $n,m,S$ . Here, $1≤n≤50000,0≤m≤50000,1≤S≤n$

The following $m$ lines contain directed edges: edge is given as a pair of vertices $u_i,v_i$

## Output

Output one integer as your answer.

## Sample Input

```
5000 2 238
3212 238
238 3212
```

## Sample Output

```
4998
