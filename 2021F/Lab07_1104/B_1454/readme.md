## Problem B: Leaves

Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Given a tree whose nodes are numbered from 1 to $n$. You are asked to print all the leaf nodes of the tree in ascending order. The root of the tree is node 1.

## Input

The first line contains one integer $n(1≤n≤1000000)$, indicating the number of nodes in the tree.

Then $n−1$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $u,v(1≤u,v≤n)$ describing an edge, indicating the indices of nodes which form an edge.

## Output

One line contains integers in ascending order. Multiple integers in one line must be separated by one space.

## Sample Input

```
4
1 2
1 3
3 4
```

## Sample Output

```
2 4
```
