Time Limit: 2 Sec Memory Limit: 1024 MB

## Description

There are $n$ cities, $m$ **bidirectional** roads connect to these $n$ cities, each road has a cost. These $m$ roads ensure that $n$ cities connect to each other. 

Please find out the minimum cost to connect these $n$ cities.

## Input

The first line contains two integers $n,m(1≤n≤10^5,1≤m≤5∗10^5)$, indicating there are $n$ cities and $m$ roads.

The next m lines, each line contains three integers $u, v, w(1≤u,v≤n,1≤w≤10^9)$, indicating that there is a road between $u$ and $v$, cost $w$. 

## Output

Please output the minimum cost to connect these $n$ cities.
