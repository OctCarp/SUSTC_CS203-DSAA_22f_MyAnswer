## Problem C: Advanced Mathematics Problem

Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB Special Judge

## Description

Given $F(x) = xe^{x/20} - b$, (x ϵ R, $e$ is a constant approximately equal to 2.718281828459, also known as Euler number, b is a given integer).

Please find the zero point of $F(x)$.

## Input

The 1st line is a positive integer $T(1⩽T⩽1000)$ which is the number of test cases.

Then $T$ lines follow. Each line has an integer $b(1⩽b⩽10^8)$ for a test case.

## Output

Output $T$ lines. Each line contains a number $ans$(accurate up to 10 decimal places), representing the approximate zero point of $F(x)$ and $|F(ans)|<0.01$.

## Sample Input
