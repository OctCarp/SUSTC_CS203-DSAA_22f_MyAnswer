## Problem A: Binary Search

Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Given a nondecreasing sequence $a$ with length $n$. We want to know whether integer $x$ in the array $a$ or not.

## Input

The 1st line is a positive integer $n(1⩽n⩽100000)$

The 2nd line contains $n$ integers: $a_1,a_2,...a_n$. For each $a_i(0⩽a_i⩽10^9)$

The 3rd line is a positive integer $T(1⩽T⩽100000)$ which is the number of test case.

Then $T$ lines follow. Each contains an integer $x(1⩽x⩽10^9)$ for a test case.

## Output

For each test case, print "`YES`" (in a single line, without quotes) if $x$ is in $a$, otherwise print "`NO`".

## Sample Input

```
4
1 2 3 999999
2
99 
3
```

## Sample Output

```
NO
YES
```
