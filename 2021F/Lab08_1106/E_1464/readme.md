## Problem E: Medium

Time Limit: 3 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Given an array of length $N: A_1,A_2,...A_N$. For every $1≤i≤N$ you are asked to figure out the medium of $A_1,A_2,...A_i$. The medium of $A_1,A_2,...A_i$ is defined as the $⌈i/2⌉$ th element of $\{A_i\}$ after it is sorted.

## Input

The first line contains one integer $N(1≤N≤5×10^5)$

The second line contains $N$ integers $A_1,A_2,...A_N(1≤A_i≤10^9)$

## Output

Output $N$ integers in a single line separated by spaces, the $i$-th of which represents the medium of $A_1,A_2,...A_i$

## Sample Input

```
5
2 5 1 4 7
```

## Sample Output

```
2 2 2 2 4
```
