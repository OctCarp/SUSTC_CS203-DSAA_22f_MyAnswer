## Counting Triples

Time Limit: 2 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

There is an array $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$. Do you know how many triples $(i,j,k)$ are there, which satisfy that $i \textless j \textless k$ and $a_i+a_j+a_k=S$ ?

## Input

The first line contains two integers $n(1≤n≤3∗10^3),S(1≤S≤10^9)$, indicating the length of the array and the sum of three elements for each triple.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,...a_n(1≤a_i≤10^9)$, indicating the array. It's guaranteed that the array is non-decreasing.

## Output

Output the answer in one line.
