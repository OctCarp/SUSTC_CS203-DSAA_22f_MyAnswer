## Bubble Sort

Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Vince is curious about how many swap times does *Bubble Sort* need to sort an array. He implements *Bubble Sort Algorithm* within 0.000001 second and gets the answer. Now, he wants to find a more efficient way to calculate. Could you solve it?

In Bubble Sort algorithm, you can only swap **adjacent** elements.

## Input

The first line will be an integer $T (1 ≤ T ≤10)$, which is the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line will be an integer $n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) $showing the length of array. Then there are n integers. It is guaranteed that each number will not exceed the limit of int.

## Output

For each case, please output the swap times that *Bubble Sort* needs to sort the array.

## Sample Input
