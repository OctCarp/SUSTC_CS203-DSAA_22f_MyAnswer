## Problem C: FSA

Time Limit: 1 Sec Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

As learned in the lecture, FSA can be used to solve string matching problems. Here you are given a string $S$, and you are required to output it's transition function according to the FSA algorithm.

## Input

One line, indicating the input string $S(1≤|S|≤10^5)$.

## Output

$|S|$ lines, each containing 26 integers, indicating the transition function.

## Sample Input

```
aabaaabb
```

## Sample Output
